# **Basics of Git and GitHub**
## **What is Git?**

### Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase and collaborate efficiently. It provides a complete history of changes and enables safe experimentation through branching and merging.

## **Why Use Git?**

- **Collaboration**: Work with teams without overwriting each other's work.
- **Backup**: Secure your code and recover previous versions.
- **Branching and Merging**: Test new features safely.
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight and fast, even for large projects.

## **GitHub Overview**

### GitHub is a **platform for hosting and managing code** using Git. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and maintain code quality through features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.

## Importance in Team Collaboration

- **Centralized Codebase**: A single source of truth for all team members.
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Work together in real-time on the same project.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Manage tasks, review code, and track progress easily.

### GitHub simplifies development and fosters collaboration, making it essential for any team working on software projects.
