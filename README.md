# **Commit Message Rules:**


Writing clear and standardized commit messages ensures that your project's history is easy to read and understand. Follow these rules when creating commit messages:

---

## **Rules for Writing Commit Messages**

1. **Use the Present Tense**
   - Describe what the commit does, not what you did.
   - ✅ Example: `Add user authentication`
   - ❌ Avoid: `Added user authentication`

2. **Capitalize the First Letter**
   - Always start the commit message with a capital letter.
   - ✅ Example: `Fix pagination issue`
   - ❌ Avoid: `fix pagination issue`

3. **Keep It Short and Concise**
   - Limit the subject line to **50 characters or less**.
   - If more detail is needed, add a body below the subject line.

4. **Use Categorization Prefixes**
   - Begin the message with a prefix to categorize the change:
     - `feat:` for new features
     - `fix:` for bug fixes
     - `docs:` for documentation updates
     - `chore:` for non-functional tasks (e.g., build updates)
     - `test:` for adding or updating tests
     - `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature

   - ✅ Examples:
     ```bash
     feat: Add tea selection feature
     fix: Resolve login issue for tea enthusiasts
     docs: Update README with chai varieties
     ```

5. **Optional Body for Details**
   - If the subject line isn't enough, add a body explaining **what** and **why**.
   - Separate the subject line and body with a blank line.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     feat: Add tea selection feature

     Users can now select their favorite tea type during checkout.
     This feature improves personalization and enhances user experience.
     ```

6. **Avoid Unnecessary Words**
   - Skip words like "Fixing" or "Working on"—be direct and to the point.
   - ✅ Example: `fix: Resolve payment gateway error`
   - ❌ Avoid: `Fixing the issue with the payment gateway`

---

## **Examples of Standardized Commit Messages**

- **Feature Addition:**
  ```bash
  feat: Implement dark mode toggle
  ```

# **Branching Workflow:**

To maintain an organized workflow, we follow a simple and effective branching strategy. This ensures that all contributors can work simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

---

## **Branching Strategy**

1. **`main` Branch**
   - The primary branch that always contains the **stable production-ready code**.
   - Direct commits to the `main` branch are **not allowed**.

2. **`development` Branch**
   - The branch where the latest **integrated changes** are tested before merging into `main`.
   - All feature branches are merged into `development` after review.

3. **Feature Branches**
   - Created for individual features, bug fixes, or tasks.
   - Named descriptively, e.g., `feature/tea-menu` or `fix/login-issue`.

---

## **Creating and Switching Branches**

To create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature/tea-menu

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature/tea-menu

# Alternatively, create and switch in one step
git checkout -b feature/tea-menu

#Verify the branch you’re on with:
git branch
```

---   

## **Merging Branches**
When your feature is complete and reviewed, merge it into development:

### Switch to the development branch:

```bash
git checkout development
```

### Merge the feature branch:

```bash
git merge feature/tea-menu
```
---
## **Resolving Merge Conflicts**
If there are conflicts during merging, follow these steps:

1. Git will highlight the files with conflicts. Open the conflicting files, and look for conflict markers like this:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Code from the current branch
=======
// Code from the branch being merged
>>>>>>> feature/tea-menu
```
2. Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict, keeping the desired code.

3.Once resolved, mark the file as resolved:

```bash
git add <file-name>
``` 
4. Commit the merge with a meaningful message:

```bash
git commit
```

# **Pull Requests (PR)**

Pull Requests (PRs) allow you to propose changes to a repository and collaborate with others on code reviews.

---

## **Steps to Create a Pull Request**

### Step 1: Push Your Changes
Ensure your changes are pushed to the appropriate branch on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Repository
   -Go to the repository on GitHub.
   -Click the Pull Requests tab.

### Step 3: Open a New Pull Request
   -Click New Pull Request.
   -Choose the base branch (e.g., main or development) and the compare branch (your branch).

### Step 4: Review the Changes
   -GitHub will show the changes you’re proposing.
   -Verify everything is correct.
   -If you need to make changes, go back to your local repository, make the changes,

### Step 5: Add a Title and Description
   -Title: Summarize the changes in a short, clear statement.
      Example: feat: Add tea selection feature
   -Description: Provide more details, including:
      What the change does.
      Why it’s necessary.
      Any dependencies or related issues.
   -Example:
      ```markdown

# **Best Practices for Git Workflow**

## **1. Importance of Regular Commits**
Regular commits are crucial to maintaining a clean and manageable code history. Here’s why:
- **Track Progress**: Committing regularly allows you to track your work and see the evolution of your code over time.
- **Easy Rollback**: Smaller, frequent commits make it easier to revert changes if something goes wrong.
- **Collaboration**: When working with others, regular commits ensure that everyone is on the same page and reduces the chances of conflicts.

### Best Practices:
- Commit often, ideally after completing each feature or task.
- Avoid waiting too long to commit. This ensures your changes are easier to manage and troubleshoot.

---

## **2. Descriptive Commit Messages**
Clear and descriptive commit messages are essential for understanding the purpose of each change. Here’s how to write effective commit messages:

- **Use the present tense**: Example: `Fix typo in README` (not `Fixed typo in README`).
- **Keep it concise but informative**: Try to summarize the change in 50 characters or less. If more details are necessary, add them in the body of the commit message.
- **Categorize commits**: Use prefixes such as:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `chore:` for routine maintenance
- **Avoid vague messages**: Instead of `Update code`, say something like `Add error handling to user login`.

### Example:
```bash
feat: Implement dark mode toggle feature
fix: Resolve login issue on mobile devices
docs: Update README with new setup instructions
```
---
## **3. Pull Updates Regularly to Avoid Conflicts**

Pulling updates frequently is essential to keep your local repository in sync with the remote repository, especially when working with a team. Here’s why:

- **Stay Updated**: Pulling updates ensures that you are working with the latest changes made by your team.
- **Avoid Conflicts**: If you don't pull frequently, you may encounter merge conflicts later. Regular pulls help minimize these conflicts.
- **Smooth Collaboration**: By pulling often, you ensure that your changes are always compatible with others’ work, making collaboration smoother.
- **Best Practices**:
   - **Pull before starting work**: Always pull the latest changes before you start your day or begin working on a new feature.
   - **Pull before committing**: If you're unsure about conflicts, pull and resolve any issues before committing your changes.
   - **Use git pull regularly**: It’s a good practice to pull at least once every day or before every major change.
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
By following these practices, you'll maintain a cleaner history, ensure smoother collaboration, and reduce the chances of conflicts, making the development process more efficient.

With Git and GitHub, you now have the tools to collaborate effectively, track your progress, and bring your projects to life—happy coding!
